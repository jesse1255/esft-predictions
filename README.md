## Why These Numbers Are Not Fitted

A common first reaction: *how can one formula match 152 particles?* The answer is that these are not fits. The mass formula m = Λε^n contains no adjustable parameters — the exponent n is fixed by the topological winding number, and its numerator and denominator are built from exactly two integers: the color gauge dimension N_c = 3 and the weak isospin dimension N_w = 2. These are the same integers that define SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) in the Standard Model, but here they are not inputs — they arise from the rank-3 Hopf soliton topology (Paper II).

Every deviation from experiment therefore has a structural meaning: it reflects either (a) a higher-order topological correction not yet included, or (b) a genuine prediction that differs from the Standard Model. The two worst cases (η meson at 16.7% and W boson at 13.9%) are traced to specific physical mechanisms (axial anomaly and Weinberg angle splitting) that, when corrected using only N_c and N_w, bring both within 3%.

### Fermion Masses — Zero Free Parameters

All predictions below use a single fitted scale ϙ = 0.003 fm. The exponents n are determined entirely by gauge group dimensions (N_c = 3, N_w = 2) and Fibonacci structure.

## Core Parameters

| Symbol | Value | Source | Role |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| ϙ (Qoppa) | 0.003 fm | Paper I, Eq. (12) | Fitted to α_EM; single free parameter |
| √σ | 459 MeV | Paper II, Eq. (37) | Derived from ϙ via topological string tension |
| η | 1/4 | Nelson–Kosterlitz (1977) | BKT universal exponent; not fitted |

All 24 predictions follow from these inputs. Zero additional free parameters beyond ϙ.

## Results Summary

Papers I–III established 24 predictions from 2 scales (ϙ, √σ) + BKT η = 1/4.
Papers IV–XI extend this to 152+ predictions covering the full particle spectrum,
mixing matrices, gravity, quantum mechanics, and scattering.

| Scope | Count | Best accuracy |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| Particle masses (Papers III, VII) | 152 | m_e: 0.2%, m_b: 0.2% |
| CKM mixing (Paper IX) | 4 parameters | θ₁₃: 0.1% |
| PMNS mixing (Paper IX) | 4 parameters | θ₂₃: 0.02% |
| Hadronic physics (Paper V) | 5 observables | m_ω: 0.3%, f_π: 2.0% |
| Scattering (Paper XI) | 2 amplitudes + predictions | π-π: 2.8% |

## AI Disclosure

AI-assisted tools were used for algebraic verification, numerical cross-checks,
